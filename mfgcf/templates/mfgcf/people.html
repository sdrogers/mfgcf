                        Simon is a <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~srogers/">a senior lecturer</a>  in the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">School of Computing Science</a>
                        at the University of Glasgow.
                        His research interest involves the development of Machine Learning and Statistical techniques to
                        help with the analysis of complex datasets, particularly within the field of Metabolomics but also
                        other -omics fields, Human-Computer Interaction and Information Retrieval.
                        His metabolomics work is done in collaboration with many people, particularly
                        <a href="http://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/">Glasgow Polyomics</a> (of which he's an affiliate member).

                        After his PhD in Wageningen, The Netherlands, <a href="http://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/JJJ-Justin-van-der-Hooft-MSc.htm">Justin</a> moved to Glasgow Polyomics to
                        work with Dr Karl Burgess and Prof. Mike Barrett and different partners from Glasgow Polyomics. Justin obtained an ISSF Fellowship from the Wellcome Trust to work on
                        method development and implementation of fragmentation approaches to enhance the metabolite annotation capacities of the high-resolution LC-MS systems focusing on small
                        polar metabolites in urine, beer, and bacterial extracts. Justin has been working on several metabolomics projects thereby exploiting the information-rich fragmentation
                        data that modern mass spectrometers generate and alleviate the bottleneck of metabolite annotation and identification in untargeted metabolomics approaches. In the MS2LDA
                        project, Justin provides valuable biological data interpretations and insights that is crucial to the development of the system. He recently moved back to his academic roots
                        to take up a shared Postdoc position between WUR and the group of Prof. Pieter Dorrestein at the UCSD, USA. The work will be focusing on how to combine workflows developed
                        for genome and metabolome mining to aid in functional annotations of genes and structural annotations of metabolites.

                        at <a href="http://www.polyomics.gla.ac.uk/">Glasgow Polyomics</a>, University of Glasgow. Before working at Glasgow Polyomics, Joe was a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/">School of Computing Science</a>, supervised by Simon.
                        His research interest is data integration and the application of machine learning methods to the analysis of complex biological data.
                        In particular, this also involves the necessary large-scale processing of data required prior to modelling and also the effective visualisations of analysis results.
